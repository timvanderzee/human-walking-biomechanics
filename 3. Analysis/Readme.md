# Analysis #

This folder includes two scripts that can be used to further analyse the 5 strides data:
- analyse_biomechanics_script.m
- analyse_soft_tissue_work.m

## analyse_biomechanics_script.m ##
analyse_biomechanics_script.m can be used to compute summary data such as mechanical work and average force, from the 5 strides of good quality data. 

## analyse_soft_tissue_work.m ##
analyse_soft_tissue_work.m can be used to investigate how soft tissue work changes with walking speed and step length, as discussed [in this paper](https://journals.biologists.com/jeb/article/224/18/jeb239889/272226/Soft-tissue-deformations-explain-most-of-the).

It creates the summary figure shown below (see [the paper](https://journals.biologists.com/jeb/article/224/18/jeb239889/272226/Soft-tissue-deformations-explain-most-of-the) for explanation).
