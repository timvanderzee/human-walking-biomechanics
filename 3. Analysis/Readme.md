# Analysis #

analyse_biomechanics_script.m can be used to compute summary data such as mechanical work and average force, from the 5 strides of good quality data. 
The script outputs a summary data file called Wsoft.mat. 

Next, analyse_soft_tissue_work.m can be used to investigate how soft tissue work changes with walking speed and step length, as discussed [in this paper](https://journals.biologists.com/jeb/article/224/18/jeb239889/272226/Soft-tissue-deformations-explain-most-of-the).
